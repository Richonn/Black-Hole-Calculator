# Black-Hole-Calculator

This is a calculator for several stuff about black holes.

You can ask for mass, temperature, area, radius, gravity on the "surface", remaining lifetime and the energy that a black hole emits.

Mass, Area and Radius are good only for Schwarzschild's blackholes. Those are Black Holes with a mass strictly positive and an electric charge equal to 0.

Compile using g++, and launch it, follow the steps and ask whatever you want to know about a balck hole.
